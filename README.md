# Lazy-staking-v2-solidity
This is the Staking Contract which doesn't need to send the NFTs to this contract.

You can, but we don’t like it. It involves effort on our part and messes with our algorithms, so you will lose 100% of the fees you paid and any earned $Dusty tokens. However, we recognise the value of your NFT’s might well increase significantly over the course of the year and you may decide it is well worth it. Your call. If you’re happy with those terms just select your stored NFT’s and click ‘Dust ‘em off and remove from storage’.

# Main advantage of this Contract
You can only set the staking and after a year you can receive $Dusty.
If you transfer NFTs to the other wallet or the other contract, it will be tracked and you can't receive the reward.
